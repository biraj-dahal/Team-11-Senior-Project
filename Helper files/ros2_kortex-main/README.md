**Note:** There are several CI jobs checking against future upstream changes see [detailed build status](.github/workflows/README.md) for a full list of CI jobs and for more information.


## Getting started

1. Install ROS 2.

   If you're a developer, we recommend using Rolling to get the latest features and fixes.

   Rolling Release: [Install ROS2 Rolling](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)<br/>
   Latest LTS Release: [Install ROS2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)</br>
   Previous Stable LTS Release: [Install ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

   After installing a version of ROS, source the setup.bash, which will set the `$ROS_DISTRO` environment variable.

**NOTE** Please use the `Humble_Gazebo_Classic_Support` branch for ROS2 Humble and the `main` branch for ROS2 Jazzy

2. Install this package from binary
   ```
   sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-kortex-bringup
   ```

3. Optional: install MoveIt Configuration and Cyclone DDS

   If you have a 7dof arm:
   ```
   sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-kinova-gen3-7dof-robotiq-2f-85-moveit-config
   ```
   If you have a 6dof arm:
   ```
   sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-kinova-gen3-6dof-robotiq-2f-85-moveit-config
   ```
   If you plan to use MoveIt, it is recommended to install and use Cyclone DDS.
   ```
   sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
   export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
   ```

4. Go to Usage section

## Contributing to this repository or building from source

Note: It is recommended to use a released binary version of this package and apt install it.
If you want the latest version of this repository for testing latest fixes
check out testing with pre-released binaries: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Testing.html

If the bug fix you need isn't in a released version or If you want to build this repository from source or contribute back to the repository read on.

1. Make sure that `colcon`, its extensions, and `vcs` are installed:
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions python3-vcstool
   ```

2. Create a new ROS2 workspace:
   ```
   export COLCON_WS=~/workspace/ros2_kortex_ws
   mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
   ```

3. Pull relevant packages:
   ```
   cd $COLCON_WS
   git clone https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros2_kortex.git src/ros2_kortex
   vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/ros2_kortex/ros2_kortex.$ROS_DISTRO.repos
   vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/ros2_kortex/ros2_kortex-not-released.$ROS_DISTRO.repos
   ```

   If you plan on simulating the robot with Gazebo, make sure to pull the additional simulation packages.
   If you're on ROS 2 Humble, run
   ```
   vcs import src --skip-existing --input src/ros2_kortex/simulation.jazzy.repos
   ```

   otherwise
   ```
   vcs import --skip-existing --input src/ros2_kortex/simulation.repos
   ```

   If you plan on using MoveIt, you must make sure that you have it already [installed](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/binary/) either from binaries or by building it from source.


4. Follow the instructions to install [Gazebo Harmonic](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/getstarted/)

5. Install dependencies, compile, and source the workspace:
   ```
   rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths src -y -r
   colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

   By default, colcon will use as much resources as possible to build the ROS2 workspace. This can temporarily freeze or even crash your machine. You can limit the number of threads used to avoid this issue, we found a good tradeoff between build time and resource utilisation by setting it to 3 :
   ```
   colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --parallel-workers 3
   ```
6. Source the previously built workspace using the following command:
   ```
   echo 'source ~/workspace/ros2_kortex_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

## Simulation Issues

Please note, at this time there are two known issues you with simulation

1. Gazebo + Mimic Joints for the Robotiq Gripper
2. Protobuf version mismatch

# Gazebo and Mimic Joints

A pull request has been made to gz_ros2_control which is how this repository was tested in simulation.
The pull request won't be merged as the fix should be done upstream in gz-sim.
Once a fix is available ros2_robotiq_gripper will be re-released and an update should fix any workarounds.

In the meantime if you need simulation checkout the upstream pull request link:

- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/issues/1684
- Upstream Pull Request: https://github.com/ros-controls/gz_ros2_control/pull/86
- Tracking Issue: https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/ros2_robotiq_gripper/issues/7

# Protobuf

Due to mismatched protobuf version that ships system and used by Gazebo simulator compiling twice may be required.
You will only run into this if you have certain other gazebo related code in your workspace while compiling this repository.
If errors are encounter you must clean your workspace and run colcon build in two steps:

1. build everything except kortex related packages
2. build the packages that where skipped

```
sudo apt install python3-colcon-clean # if you don't have colcon-clean installed already
colcon clean workspace -y
colcon build --packages-skip-regex '.*kortex.*' '.*gen3.*'
colcon build --packages-select-regex '.*kortex.*' '.*gen3.*'
```

## Usage
To launch and view any of the robot's URDF run:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_description view_robot.launch.py
```

The accepted arguments are:

* `robot_type` : Your robot model. Possible values are either `gen3` or `gen3_lite`, the default is `gen3`.

* `gripper` : Gripper to use. Possible values for the Gen3 are either `robotiq_2f_85` or `robotiq_2f_140`. For the Gen3 Lite, the only option is `gen3_lite_2f`. Default value is an empty string, which will display the arm without a gripper.

* `dof` : Degrees of freedom of the arm. Possible values for the Gen3 are either `6` or `7`. For the Gen3 Lite, the only option is `6`. Default value is `7`.

### Gen 3 Robots

The `gen3.launch.py` launch file is designed to be used for Gen3 arms. The typical use case to bringup and visualize the 7 DoF Kinova Gen3 robot arm (default) with mock hardware on Rviz:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_bringup gen3.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy \
  use_fake_hardware:=true
```

Alternatively, for a physical robot:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_bringup gen3.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=192.168.1.10 \
```
You can specify the following arguments if you wish to change your arm configuration:

* `robot_type`: Your robot model. Default value (and only one) is `gen3`.

* `gripper` : Gripper to use. Possible values for the Gen3 are either `robotiq_2f_85`, `robotiq_2f_140` or `""`. Default is `""`. An empty string will not initialise any gripper.

#### Robotiq gripper

The Robotiq 2f 85 (or 2f 140) Gripper will be available on the Action topic:

```bash
/robotiq_gripper_controller/gripper_cmd
```

You can test the gripper by calling the Action server with the following command and setting the desired `position` of the gripper (`0.0=open`, `0.8=close`)

```bash
ros2 action send_goal /robotiq_gripper_controller/gripper_cmd control_msgs/action/GripperCommand "{command:{position: 0.0, max_effort: 100.0}}"
```

#### Vision Module

In order to access the Kinova Vision module's depth and color streams for the camera-equipped Gen3 arm models, please refer to the following github repository for detailed instructions: [ros2_kortex_vision](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros2_kortex_vision)

### Gen 3 Lite Robot

The `gen3_lite.launch.py` launch file is designed to be used for Gen3 Lite arms. The typical use case to bringup the robot arm with mock hardware:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_bringup gen3_lite.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy \
  use_fake_hardware:=true
```
Alternatively, if you wish to use the physical robot:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_bringup gen3_lite.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=192.168.1.10 \
```

You can specify the following arguments if you wish to change your arm configuration:

* `use_sim_time` : Use simulated clock. Default value is `true`.
* `gripper` : Gripper to use. Possible values for the Gen3 are: `robotiq_2f_85`, `robotiq_2f_140`, `""` and `gen3_lite_2f`. Default is `robotiq_2f_85`. An empty string will not initialise any gripper.

#### MoveIt 2

To generate motion plans and execute them with a simulated 7 DoF Kinova Gen3 arm with mock hardware:

```bash
ros2 launch kinova_gen3_7dof_robotiq_2f_85_moveit_config robot.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy \
  use_fake_hardware:=true
```

and to bring up the Kinova Gen3 6 DoF with MoveIt:

```bash
ros2 launch kinova_gen3_6dof_robotiq_2f_85_moveit_config robot.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy \
  use_fake_hardware:=true
```

To generate motion plans and execute them with a Gazebo simulated 7 DoF Kinova Gen3 arm (previously launched with the command at the [simulation](#simulation) section):

```bash
ros2 launch kinova_gen3_7dof_robotiq_2f_85_moveit_config sim.launch.py \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

To work with a physical robot and generate/execute paths with MoveIt run the following:

For Gen3:

```bash
ros2 launch kinova_gen3_7dof_robotiq_2f_85_moveit_config robot.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=192.168.1.10
```

For Gen3-Lite:

```bash
ros2 launch kinova_gen3_lite_moveit_config robot.launch.py \
  robot_ip:=192.168.1.10
```



## Commanding the arm (physically and in simulation)
You can command the arm by publishing Joint Trajectory messages directly to the joint trajectory controller:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory "{
  joint_names: [joint_1, joint_2, joint_3, joint_4, joint_5, joint_6, joint_7],
  points: [
    { positions: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], time_from_start: { sec: 10 } },
  ]
}" -1
```

Depending on your robot type and its DoF, you will need to adapt the `joint_names` and `positions` properties accordingly. For the Gen3 Lite arm, the integrated gripper is considered as a joint, so to command it, it must be included in the `joint_names` array. (`0.0=open`, `1.0=close`):

```bash
ros2 topic pub /joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory "{
  joint_names: [joint_1, joint_2, joint_3, joint_4, joint_5, joint_6, right_finger_bottom_joint],
  points: [
    { positions: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], time_from_start: { sec: 10 } },
  ]
}" -1
```

You can also command the arm using Twist messages. Before doing so, you must active the `twist_controller` and deactivate the `joint_trajectory_controller`:
```bash
ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{
  activate_controllers: [twist_controller],
  deactivate_controllers: [joint_trajectory_controller],
  strictness: 1,
  activate_asap: true,
}"
```

**Note: the required interface for the `twist_controller` does not currently exist in the gazebo or mock hardware simulation setups. So the `twist_controller` is currently only functional on Kinova hardware.**

Once the `twist_controller` is activated, You can publish Twist messages on the `/twist_controller/commands` topic to command the arm.

For example, you can jog the arm using [Teleop Twist Keyboard](https://index.ros.org/p/teleop_twist_keyboard/github-ros2-teleop_twist_keyboard/) with the following command:

**WARNING: you are responsible for collision checking, including self collisions when in this mode.**

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args --remap /cmd_vel:=/twist_controller/commands
```

If you wish to use the `joint_trajectory_controller` again to command the arm using JointTrajectory messages, run the following:
```bash
ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{
  activate_controllers: [joint_trajectory_controller],
  deactivate_controllers: [twist_controller],
  strictness: 1,
  activate_asap: true,
}"
```
