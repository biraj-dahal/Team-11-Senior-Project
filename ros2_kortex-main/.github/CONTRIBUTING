# Branches

The main branch supports ROS 2 Rolling, however it also supports as many previous ROS 2 releases as possible.

If compatibility is not possible then a branch is created for that version of ROS 2.

New changes should first target the main branch, and then be backported, this helps maintainers ensure features and bug fixes are always in the latest release and avoids additional work maintaining both forward and back-ports.
