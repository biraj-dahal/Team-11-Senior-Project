#lets use fastapi?


# i have included boilerplate for react component for dashboard, and multiple states alr, feel free to change, add, remove

# TODO: define response models for 
# robot status, logs -> please see the logging.yaml for the configuration
# system stats maybe for our computer too? because QRScan sometime malfunctions, and crashes my IDE lol -> cpu usage, memory usage?
# state, position -> alr defined in the robot class.
# maybe use the examples from api_python to add more stats, that are built in.



# TODO: do we use in memory storage, or host a database for WebSocket Connections, and status history? 
# thoughts? 


# TODO: broadcast robot status updates to dashboard realtime.

# TODO: handle requests from the dashboard to the robot too? like stop, home, and anything we wanna add more?



# TODO: to read the log, either we read the log file, it is under log/robot.log, or we use the logging module directly to read the logs

# TODO: endpoint to retrieve system stats cpu usage, memory usage and maybe also active connections -> dont know if this is possible tho.
